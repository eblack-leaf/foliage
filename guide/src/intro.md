# Introduction

This is a UI library that focuses on lightweight abstraction over `bevy_ecs`, `wgpu`, and `winit`. This means that
features will sometimes interact closely with these crates as forwarding all of their functionality to
provide a cleaner API has not been done yet. This library is still under development and provides no promises about 
backwards compatibility until v1.0. 

This book will cover an overview of how the library works and your part in using the system. See `Entry` next to 
begin.
